## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1] - 2019-07-12
### Fixed
- Readme example is outdated

## [2.0.0] - 2019-07-12

### Changed
- This package now consolidates the Client, the Server and the Document in one single library. 
    It does not depend on `json_api_document` and `json_api_server` anymore, please remove these packages 
    from your `pubspec.yaml`.
- The min Dart SDK version bumped to `2.3.0`
- The Client requires an instance of HttpClient to be passed to the constructor explicitly.
- Both the Document and the Server have been refactored with lots of **BREAKING CHANGES**. 
    See the examples and the functional tests for details.
- Meta properties are not defensively copied, but set directly. Meta property behavior is unified across 
    the Document model.

### Removed
- `JsonApiParser` is removed. Use the static `decodeJson` methods in the corresponding classes instead.
