[JSON:API](http://jsonapi.org) is a specification for building APIs in JSON.

This package consists of several libraries:
- The [Client] to make requests to JSON:API servers
- The [Server] which is still under development
- The [Document] model for resources, relationships, identifiers, etc
- The [Query] to build and parse the query parameters (pagination, sorting, etc)
- The [URL Design] to build and match URLs for resources, collections, and relationships
