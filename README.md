# JSON:API for Dart/Flutter

[JSON:API] is a specification for building JSON APIs.

This package consists of several libraries:
- The [Client library] is a JSON:API Client for Flutter, browsers and vm.
- The [Server library] is a framework-agnostic JSON:API server implementation.
- The [Document library] is the core of this package. It describes the JSON:API document structure.
- The [HTTP library] is a thin abstraction of HTTP requests and responses.
- The [Query library] builds and parses the query parameters (page, sorting, filtering, etc).
- The [Routing library] builds and matches URIs for resources, collections, and relationships.
